# *dutree* shows a summary of the directories/files which take up the most
# space.
#
# Instead of showing *only the root of the files* with sizes, or the
# details of *every file*, it shows *only the paths taking up the most
# space*.
#
# Example usage::
#
#     $ dutree /srv
#
# Annotated output, where only paths of >5% of the total size are shown
# (which is about 4GB for this dataset)::
#
#      12.1 G  /srv/data/audiofiles/
#               ^-- audiofiles contains files/dirs with a total of 12.1G
#                   but it does NOT contain a single dir or file larger
#                   than 4G.
#       4.3 G  /srv/data/callrecordings/unmatched/
#       4.5 G  /srv/data/fax/
#      17.5 G  /srv/data/playlists/
#      34.4 G  /srv/data/twinfield_invoices/1/
#       7.8 G  /srv/data/*
#                ^-- data contains more files/directories than shown above
#                    but those that don't total above 4G are merged into
#                    this "leftover" node. that includes everything in
#                    /twinfield_invoices/ except for the /1/ subdirectory
#                    which has its individual listing above.
#      32   B  /srv/*
#                ^-- only /data/ is in /srv/, but the directory itself also
#                    takes up a tiny bit of space
#       -----
#      80.6 G  TOTAL (86558511658)

# **NOTE**: The directories do not count the size of themselves, only of
# their contents. This explains any discrepancies with ``du -sb`` output.
